Description
This app predicts the likelihood of developing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) based on key health parameters. Built using Streamlit and a logistic regression model trained on the Framingham dataset, it provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health details and receive a personalized risk assessment.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Input fields for age, sex, smoking habits, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and glucose.
Real-Time Prediction: Displays the probability of CHD risk and highlights whether the risk is low or high.
Interactive Visualizations: Progress bars and charts visualize prediction probabilities.
Example Dataset: Users can view a sample of the dataset for reference.
Customizable Inputs: Supports normal and abnormal ranges for health parameters.
Disclaimer Section: Educates users on the statistical nature of predictions and the need for professional medical consultation.
Technology Stack
Python: For data preprocessing and model development.
Streamlit: To build an interactive and responsive UI.
Scikit-learn: For logistic regression and model evaluation.
This app is designed for educational purposes and raises awareness about the risk factors of CHD.
